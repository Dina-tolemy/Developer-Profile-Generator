# -Developer-Profile-Generator
A command-line application that dynamically generates a PDF profile from a GitHub username.
it takes the user name and color and get the information needed for the resume from the user git hub account.
It shows:
(*User name 
*User location 
*User GitHub profile link 
*User blog link 
*User bio 
*Number of public repositories 
*Number of followers 
*Number of GitHub stars 
*Number of users following 
*User Email.)



It uses the user color as the font color of the header and sub headers.
I used PDFMake for creating the pdf resume.
