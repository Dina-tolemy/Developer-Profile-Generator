#  Developer-Profile-Generator
A command-line application that dynamically generates a PDF profile from a GitHub username.
it takes the user name and color and get the information needed for the resume from the user git hub account.
It shows: 
(*User name 
*User location 
*User GitHub profile link 
*User blog link 
*User bio *link to the repos
*Number of public repositories 
*Number of followers 
*Number of GitHub stars
